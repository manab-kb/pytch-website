About Pytch
===========

Pytch provides a bridge in the journey from Scratch to Python.

Motivation
----------

The two most common teaching languages are Scratch and Python. Learners
often start by working with Scratch, and then at some point want to make
a transition to a text-based programming language; Python is a common
choice.

Many factors make the transition from Scratch to Python a difficult one.
Simplifying, we can see that there are two substantial differences:

-  Instead of assembling their program via drag and drop of interlocking
   blocks, the learner must type code into a text editor, attending to
   spelling, syntax, and so on.
-  Instead of an environment providing a set of concurrently running
   sprites, with built-in behaviours such as movement, costumes, and
   collision detection, the learner must work with an entirely new
   runtime, with a very different programming model.

Currently, the learner must make both these changes to their
understanding at the same time.

Pytch’s contribution
--------------------

We break this leap into two smaller steps. Pytch provides a programming
environment with the familiarity of Scratch’s model and runtime, but
where behaviour is expressed using textual Python code rather than
blocks. Pytch projects resemble Scratch projects, with a Stage and as
many interacting Sprites as required. The learner can concentrate on
becoming familiar with Python’s syntax.

Status
------

The implementation is at the prototype stage. We would very much welcome
feedback from people with experience of both Scratch and Python,
particularly those involved in education!

Acknowledgements

We rely heavily on the following two excellent projects:

-  `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/>`_ — MIT’s graphical programming
   environment, whose ideas are the motivation behind Pytch
-  `Skulpt <https://skulpt.org/>`_ — an in-browser implementation of
   the Python language, on which we have built Pytch
