Source and build information
============================

The various git repos making up Pytch are available on GitHub:

* `Pytch GitHub account <https://github.com/pytchlang/>`_

The preferred development method is to use the git 'superproject':

* `pytch-releases <https://github.com/pytchlang/pytch-releases>`_

This repo has all the individual repos as git submodules.  See
:doc:`developer/development-setup` for more information on how to get
set up for development work on Pytch itself.
