Privacy policy
==============

The Pytch project team is committed to protecting your privacy and
ensuring the security of your data.  This privacy statement outlines
how we handle user data when you use our Web App.

Data collection and use
-----------------------

We do not collect any user data directly on our servers or database.
We do not store any of your files or personal information on our
servers.  Your projects are stored on your own device.

However, our web app can, if you give permission, connect to your
Google Drive account to access the files you have stored there.  The
Web App can only access files you directly tell it to open or that it
has created itself.  Any data we access is only used to provide the
services you have requested.

Google Drive access
-------------------

When you use the Web App, you can choose to use the "export to /
import from Google Drive" features.  If you do, you will be asked to
authorize our application to access your Google Drive account.  This
permission allows our app to read, modify, and delete its own files
and files you directly tell it to open, in your Google Drive account,
as needed.  We only access the files that you explicitly give
permission for us to access.  Your use of Google Drive is governed by
Google's terms of service.

Data security
-------------

We take data security seriously and have implemented appropriate
measures to protect your data.  All data transfers between our web app
and Google Drive are encrypted using industry-standard protocols.  We
use code provided by Google to do this.  Our servers are secured with
the latest security patches and updates to ensure the safety of your
data.

Changes to this privacy policy
------------------------------

We reserve the right to update this privacy statement at any time.
The current version will always be available here.

By using the Web App, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy
policy.
